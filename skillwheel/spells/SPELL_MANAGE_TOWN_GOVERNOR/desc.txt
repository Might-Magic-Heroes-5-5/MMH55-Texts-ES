If "Town Management" is used when the hero is in the town garrison on the adventure map, he can be assigned as the city Governor. Governors gain an amount of experience every day and various exclusive bonuses from town buildings. Under a Governor management the town benefits from increased dwelling production % equal to the hero level (rounded down). Moreover if the hero has any "Regalia of the Legion" artifact, the troops will be added to the town dwellings instead and the amount will be calculated as if the hero has 5 more knowledge.
